/**
 * Default arities for the Core Language primitives, derived from the C3 signature matrix in
 * [`spec/commands.md`](../../../spec/commands.md). OpenLogo calls are prefix and
 * space-separated, and each callable has one fixed default arity, so the reader needs these
 * counts to group a fixed call's arguments: `forward random 100` reads as
 * `forward (random 100)` only because `random` is known to take one input.
 *
 * This registry holds the **Core** surface only; the Turtle & Rendering and later profiles
 * extend it with their own primitives in their slices. Infix and unary operators
 * (`+ - * / mod == != < > <= >= and or not`) are not listed here — the grammar groups them
 * by precedence, and the AST records them as {@link CallNode}s with the operator as callee.
 * Variadic forms such as `(print :a :b)` or `(random a b)` use the parenthesized call and so
 * do not depend on the default arity.
 *
 * Every fixed-arity Core Reporter and Command from `commands.md` must appear here: an omitted
 * name falls back to arity `0` in the reader, so its arguments are silently left on the line as
 * stray statements instead of being gathered — a quiet miscount with no diagnostic. Special
 * forms (`if`/`while`/`repeat`/`for`/`forever`/`define`/`return`/`stop`/`throw`/`local`/
 * `map`/`filter`/`reduce`) and the literals `true`/`false` are handled by dedicated grammar
 * productions, not this table.
