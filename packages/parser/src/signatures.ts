/**
 * Default arities for the Core Language primitives, derived from the C3 signature matrix in
 * [`spec/commands.md`](../../../spec/commands.md). OpenLogo calls are prefix and
 * space-separated, and each callable has one fixed default arity, so the reader needs these
 * counts to group a fixed call's arguments: `forward random 100` reads as
 * `forward (random 100)` only because `random` is known to take one input.
 *
 * This registry holds the **Core** surface only; the Turtle & Rendering and later profiles
 * extend it with their own primitives in their slices. Infix and unary operators
 * (`+ - * / mod == != < > <= >= and or not`) are not listed here — the grammar groups them
 * by precedence, and the AST records them as {@link CallNode}s with the operator as callee.
 * Variadic forms such as `(print :a :b)` or `(random a b)` use the parenthesized call and so
 * do not depend on the default arity.
