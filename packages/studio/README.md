# `@openlogo/studio`

**The OpenLogo UI that runs in a browser.** A TypeScript web app hosting the code editor/REPL, the
**Canvas** turtle view, the diagnostics UI, and the lesson/tutor pane, with Run/Stop/Reset/Step,
persistence, and accessibility. It composes the other packages and owns no language logic.

- **Source root:** `src/` — app entry `src/index.ts`; keep a headless `run-controller.ts` + state
  model separate from the view/DOM so it is testable without a browser.
- **Owner:** [`@learner-experience`](../../.github/agents/learner-experience.agent.md).
- **Working rules:** [`studio.instructions.md`](../../.github/instructions/studio.instructions.md).
- **Spec:** [`rendering.md`](../../spec/rendering.md) (Canvas target + controls + a11y),
  [`tooling.md`](../../spec/tooling.md) (LSP integration),
  [`interaction-events.md`](../../spec/interaction-events.md).
- **Depends on:** `@openlogo/parser`, `@openlogo/runtime`, `@openlogo/turtle`, `@openlogo/edu`,
  `@openlogo/core`.

## State model + app shell (#123)

Every pane composes over **one** shared instance — never a per-pane copy:

- `createStudioState()` (`src/state-model.ts`) — the single source of truth: `source`
  (document text), `selection` (cursor/selection), `runStatus`
  (`"idle" | "running" | "stopped"`), `diagnostics` (`@openlogo/core` `Diagnostic[]`), `output`
  (learner-visible printed lines from the most recent run, #126), `lesson` (lesson context for
  `@openlogo/edu` content), and `notice` (a non-fatal, learner-visible status set by e.g. #128
  persistence when it degrades gracefully). State changes only through its `set*` methods;
  `getState()` is stable by reference between changes, and `subscribe` notifies listeners
  synchronously after every change — see the doc comment in `state-model.ts` for the full contract.
- `createAppShell(state)` (`src/app-shell.ts`) — a composable region registry (`editor`,
  `turtle`, `diagnostics`, `lesson`, `repl`), each starting as an empty placeholder. Later panes
  (#124 editor, #125 diagnostics, #126 run/stop, #127 lesson, #128 persistence, #129 a11y) call
  `shell.mount(region, pane)` to compose themselves in, and read/write state via `shell.state`
  (the same store instance, not a copy).

No studio shell framework/bundler is pinned yet (deferred in ADR-0001), so this slice models the
shell headlessly (plain objects, no DOM) to stay simple and testable under `node:test`; a later
slice may swap in a real renderer without changing this contract.

## Editor pane (#124)

- `createEditorController(state, options?)` (`src/editor.ts`) — the headless editing controller:
  `getText`/`getSelection` read straight from the shared state model; `setText`/`setSelection`/
  `insertText`/`deleteBackward`/`deleteForward` write straight through it. There is no private
  text buffer, so two controllers over the same store always agree — the #123 single-source-of-
  truth contract holds through editing.
- `mountEditorPane(shell, controller)` composes the controller into the shell's `editor` region.
- Syntax coloring is a pluggable seam: `getTokens()` delegates to a `HighlightProvider` (default
  `noopHighlighter`, i.e. plain text). This slice has no hard dependency on the epic #118
  highlighter — pass a provider built from `@openlogo/parser`'s `semanticTokens` once you want
  real coloring; this module never re-implements token classification itself.
- See `editor.ts`'s doc comment for the DOM/mount integration contract a later real-widget slice
  (e.g. a `<textarea>`/CodeMirror/Monaco host) should follow to stay headless-first and avoid
  ever forking the document text or regressing keyboard operability.

## Persistence (#128)

- `attachPersistence(state, options?)` (`src/persistence.ts`) — the smallest mechanism that
  satisfies "a learner's document text survives a reload." It restores `source` from a
  `StorageAdapter` once at creation, then re-saves it on every change (skipping saves when
  `source` is unchanged), always through the shared state model — no forked copy of the text.
- `StorageAdapter` (`save`/`load`/`clear`) is the pluggable backend seam, matching the #123/#124
  headless-first approach: `createInMemoryStorageAdapter()` is the default, fully `node:test`-able
  implementation. A real `localStorage`-backed adapter plugs into the same three synchronous
  methods later — nothing here needs to change to support that.
- **Graceful degradation:** if the adapter throws on restore, save, or clear (quota exceeded,
  storage disabled, etc.), `attachPersistence` never lets the failure crash the session or lose
  work silently — it catches the error and calls `state.setNotice({ level: "warning", message })`,
  so a later pane can render a visible notice. The learner keeps working either way.
- `attachPersistence(...).dispose()` stops persisting further changes;
  `attachPersistence(...).clearPersisted()` removes the stored value (also degrading gracefully).

## Run/Stop/Reset/Step (#126)

- `createRunController(state, options?)` (`src/run-controller.ts`) — the headless run controller
  over `@openlogo/runtime`'s execution budget (issue #102):
  - **Run** — `run()` calls `execute(state.getState().source, document, options)` and reduces the
    returned trace-event stream to exactly what this slice surfaces: every `print` event becomes
    one `output` line (already in the runtime's canonical `printedForm`, never reformatted here),
    and the run's diagnostics replace the shared `diagnostics` list unchanged.
  - **Stop** — `stop()` flips a cancellation signal this controller owns for its whole lifetime
    and sets `runStatus` to `"stopped"` immediately. Because `execute()` is synchronous and never
    yields, a same-thread `stop()` cannot preempt a call already on the stack — true mid-loop
    interruption needs a Web Worker + `SharedArrayBuffer`/`Atomics` architecture, which is out of
    scope for this slice. What genuinely keeps a runaway `forever`/`repeat 10000 [...]` program
    from hanging the session is the **instruction budget** (`options.instructionBudget`, default
    `DEFAULT_INSTRUCTION_BUDGET`), checked before every statement/loop pass inside `execute()`
    itself. A cancelled signal stays cancelled until `reset()` re-arms it, so `stop()` then `run()`
    deterministically halts with `ol-limit`/`cancelled` rather than silently dropping the request.
  - **Reset** — `reset()` clears `output`/`diagnostics` back to empty, re-arms the cancellation
    signal, and sets `runStatus` to `"idle"` — deterministic, ready for the next `run()`.
  - **Step** — `step()` is a documented no-op: `execute()` exposes no per-instruction pause/resume
    API to step through (a single call runs the whole program and returns the full event stream at
    once), so this slice does not fake stepping the runtime doesn't support. A follow-up issue
    should track real step-through once the runtime grows an incremental execution entry point.
  - `mountRunController(shell, controller)` composes the controller into the shell's `repl` region.
- See `run-controller.ts`'s doc comment for the full same-thread cancellation rationale.

## Diagnostics pane (#125)

- `createDiagnosticsController(state, options?)` (`src/diagnostics.ts`) — subscribes to the
  shared store and, whenever `source` changes, re-parses it via `@openlogo/parser`'s `parse()`
  (Layer 1, issue #9) and republishes the result through `state.setDiagnostics`, so a bad line
  (e.g. `ol-bad-token`) surfaces at its `source_span` as the learner types, with no Run needed and
  without ever crashing the session (`parse()` reports diagnostics instead of throwing).
- **One unified rendering path for every stage.** Parse-stage (this controller), runtime-stage
  (#126's run controller, already writing `execute()`'s diagnostics into the same field), and
  semantic/style-stage (`@openlogo/parser`'s `check()`, epic #108) all flow through the exact same
  `state.diagnostics` field and render through the exact same {@link toDiagnosticsView} — there is
  no separate ad-hoc "runtime error" UI.
- **Semantic checking is opt-in**, not automatic: pass `semanticCheck: true` to also run `check()`
  after every parse. It defaults to `false` because `check()`'s `ol-unknown-command` rule does not
  yet recognize runtime-registered primitives outside Core Language, so enabling it unconditionally
  today would falsely flag an ordinary turtle program like `forward 100` as unknown-command — see
  `diagnostics.ts`'s doc comment. Flip it on once epic #108 closes that gap; no rendering-side
  change is needed when it does.
- `toDiagnosticsView(diagnostics)` — the pure projection from a raw `Diagnostic[]` to a rendering
  model (`items`/`errorCount`/`warningCount`/`isEmpty`). It keys off `code`/`severity`/`stage`/
  `params` only and never inspects `message` prose, per the diagnostic-identity rule
  (`spec/error-model.md`); `severity` stays a structured field on each item rather than being
  translated into styling here.
- `mountDiagnosticsPane(shell, controller)` composes the controller into the shell's `diagnostics`
  region.

## REPL keyboard + screen-reader accessibility (#129)

Scope: the three REPL surfaces — editor (#124), run controls (#126, mounted in the `repl` region),
and diagnostics (#125). Lesson-pane a11y is a separate slice (#127/M3). Like every prior slice,
ADR-0001 leaves the DOM/framework choice open, so this is a **headless, `node:test`-able a11y
contract/view-model layer** (`src/a11y.ts`) that a later real renderer maps onto actual DOM
attributes 1:1 — there is no DOM here to regress.

- **Keyboard operability** — `REPL_FOCUS_ORDER` is a static, ordered list of every focusable stop
  across the three panes: the editor (one `textbox` stop), Run/Stop/Reset (three `button` stops,
  matching `run-controller.ts`'s `run()`/`stop()`/`reset()`), and the diagnostics list (one `log`
  stop). `nextFocusStop`/`previousFocusStop` cycle through it, wrapping at both ends — proof there
  is no keyboard trap: from any stop you can always reach every other stop moving forward or
  backward.
- **Semantic structure** — `REPL_LANDMARK_ROLES` declares each pane's container-level ARIA role +
  label (editor≈`textbox`, run controls≈`toolbar` "Run controls", diagnostics≈`log` "Diagnostics"),
  for a renderer to map onto real `role`/`aria-label` attributes.
- **Screen-reader announcements** — `createA11yAnnouncer(state)` subscribes to the shared #123
  store (never a copy) and emits an `Announcement` (`{ politeness, message }`) whenever
  `runStatus` or `diagnostics` changes: run-status transitions ("Run started."/"Run stopped."/
  "Ready.") and diagnostics changes (e.g. "1 error found.", `politeness: "assertive"` when any
  diagnostic is an error, else `"polite"`). Announcement text is built **only** from structured
  fields (`runStatus`; diagnostics' `severity` counts) — it never reads or branches on a
  `Diagnostic.message`'s prose, per the diagnostic-identity rule already followed by
  `diagnostics.ts`. `getAnnouncements()` returns the full history; `subscribeAnnouncements(...)`
  notifies every listener with the same events, so multiple consumers never desync (the #123
  single-source-of-truth contract, once again).
- No shell region/mount function is added for the announcer itself — it is a cross-cutting service
  over the existing store, not a pane with its own visible content.
