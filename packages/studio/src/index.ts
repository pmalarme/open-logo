/**
 * `@openlogo/studio` — the browser learner IDE: editor/REPL, Canvas turtle view, run/stop/step,
 * diagnostics UI, tooling/LSP, the lesson pane, and persistence. Composes every other package;
 * it never reimplements them. Depends on core, parser, runtime, turtle, and edu.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import * as OL from "@openlogo/studio";
 * ```
 *
 * #123 established the two seams every later pane builds on:
 * - {@link createStudioState} — the **single** state model (source, selection, run status,
 *   diagnostics, lesson context). See `state-model.ts` for the full shape + update contract.
 * - {@link createAppShell} — the composable app shell (a region registry) that later panes
 *   (#124 editor, #125 diagnostics, #126 run/stop, #127 lesson, #128 persistence, #129 a11y)
 *   mount into. See `app-shell.ts`.
 *
 * #124 adds the first pane, the headless editor controller:
 * - {@link createEditorController} — editing operations (`insertText`/`deleteBackward`/
 *   `deleteForward`/`setText`/`setSelection`) that read/write straight through the shared state
 *   model, plus a pluggable {@link HighlightProvider} seam (default: {@link noopHighlighter},
 *   plain text — no hard dependency on the epic #118 highlighter). See `editor.ts`.
 * - {@link mountEditorPane} composes the controller into the shell's `editor` region.
 *
 * No run/diagnostics-rendering/lesson/persistence behavior lands yet — this slice only proves the
 * document can be edited through the one shared state model.
